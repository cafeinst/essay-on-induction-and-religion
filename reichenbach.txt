Essay

I believe that Scripture is literally true, including its account of creation. I also believe that modern science is indispensable for understanding and navigating the future. In this essay, I argue that these commitments are not in conflict, by focusing on philosopher Hans Reichenbach’s response to philosopher David Hume’s problem of induction.

Consider the following problem: The sun has risen in the morning every day in the past. How do we know that tomorrow the sun will rise? Hume generalized this question by asking how we can rationally justify making the inference from observed cases to unobserved cases without circularity. We humans make inductive inferences all the time, yet the answer to this question has puzzled philosophers.

I once asked a non-philosopher how we know that the sun will rise tomorrow, given that it has risen every day in the past. She replied something like, “Because the appearance of the sun rising is the result of the earth spinning on its axis every day. Since the earth always spins on its axis, we can expect that the sun will rise tomorrow morning.”

While her statement is scientifically accurate, philosophically it is circular. I could have challenged her by asking, “But how do we know that the earth will continue spinning on its axis tomorrow?” Perhaps she would have responded, “Because nothing is stopping the earth from spinning on its axis.” or perhaps "Newton's First Law". But I suspect she would not have understood the essence of my question.

I do not mean this as an insult; I once asked a PhD chemist similar questions and received similar answers. Most modern people are trained to think in this scientific way, which is natural given that we live in an age shaped by scientific explanation. But to truly understand nature, I think it is essential to have a good answer to Hume's problem of induction, since without some answer to Hume’s problem there is no non-pragmatic rational foundation for scientific belief, as science is fundamentally based on induction.

The only response to Hume’s problem of induction that I have found convincing in the literature is Hans Reichenbach’s pragmatic justification of induction. Reichenbach essentially argued: Either the future resembles the past or it does not. If it does not resemble the past, then all predictions about the future are equally reasonable in principle. If the future does resemble the past, then it is logical to make predictions based on the assumption that the future resembles the past. Hence, the most reasonable predictive strategy assumes that the future resembles the past, since this strategy is optimal in both situations. Notice that this solution does not claim that the future resembles the past. It only claims that the optimal procedure for predicting the future is based on the assumption that the future resembles the past.

The following is a great dilemma that has confounded many religious people: The Biblical account of world history contradicts the majority consensus of scientists regarding the history of the universe. For instance, according to Scripture, the universe is less than 6,000 years old. According to science, the universe is billions of years old. This is a huge discrepancy. Some religious apologists have dealt with this discrepancy by playing around with definitions, for instance redefining the word day in Scripture to mean a period of time, since by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, time is relative and a day could not have even been well-defined until the fourth day of creation when the sun was created with the moon and the stars. Others have put forth scientific arguments for a young earth. And some have even put forth arguments that the scientific evidence for an old universe is just a test of one's faith - if one believes the universe is billions of years, he rejects the authority of Scripture and therefore lacks faith.

Another great dilemma is evolution: the assertion that primitive forms of life evolved through random mutations into the higher forms of life we see on earth today over millions of years, as opposed to the account in Genesis that says that all animal life was created on the fifth and sixth day of creation as separate species. And also there is the global flood which the book of Genesis asserts happened a few thousand years ago, which most scientists say there is no geological evidence for existing. One could defend the Bible by trying to refute modern science, but this is easier said than done. As a person who believes that Scripture is literally true, I used to take the approach that scientists were either wrong because science is by nature uncertain or because the scientific theories were a case of misapplied extrapolation of data from today into the past. I used to argue with evolutionists on the Usenet group talk.origins with this point of view with little success of convincing anyone that my position is correct. The truth is I never felt that my position was that strong to begin with, not because it is wrong but because my position did not answer questions that people are naturally interested in, like where did we come from? The literal answer in Genesis was written not as an answer to satisfy a person's curiosity about science. It was clearly written as a summary of a complex process that no human truly understands.

My current answer to the evolution vs creation debate instead of attacking science attacks the basis for how one can make any scientific statements about the past with any degree of certainty. Hans Reichenbach's pragmatic justification for induction makes it clear that induction is pragmatically justified primarily when making predictions about the future, not retrodictions about the past. This is because only predictions about the near future can be tested. Retrodictions about the distant, unique past cannot be tested by novel predictive success. According to Reichenbach's justification, only predictions that can be tested have justification, since if a prediction cannot be tested, pragmatically speaking it does not matter whether it is right or wrong. Hence, arguments about whether the universe is less than 6,000 years old or billions of years old are moot. We will never be able to know with absolute certainty which is right, so there is little point in arguing about them as scientific questions.

However, it is important to note that not all retrodictions are epistemically on the same footing. In many cases, scientific inferences about the past are justified precisely because they contribute to reliable predictions about the future. For example, inferring the past behavior of a physical system may allow us to predict how similar systems will behave under similar conditions going forward. In such cases, retrodiction is not an end in itself, but a tool for improving future-oriented prediction. By contrast, retrodictions that concern unique, unrepeatable events in the distant past, such as the precise origin of the universe or the detailed history of early life, do not play this predictive role. They do not guide future action, nor can they be tested by their success in prediction. Within Reichenbach’s pragmatic framework, such claims therefore lack the same rational authority as inductive predictions that bear on the future.

Seen in this light, the conflict between Genesis and science arises only when scientific retrodictions are treated as if they carried the same pragmatic authority as predictive laws, a status that Reichenbach’s justification does not grant them. Reichenbach’s justification applies only to inferential methods whose success can be evaluated through future experience, a condition that predictive laws satisfy but most claims about unique events in the distant past do not.

This does not mean that claims about the past are irrelevant in every context. The events described in Scripture are not offered as scientific reconstructions intended to support prediction or technological control. Rather, they function as the foundation of a religious worldview that shapes how people understand themselves, their obligations, and their relationship to God. In this sense, biblical claims about the past have profound implications for the present and the future, not by guiding empirical prediction, but by grounding meaning, moral responsibility, and communal identity.

From this perspective, the authority of Scripture does not rest on its ability to compete with scientific retrodictions, but on its role in shaping how one ought to live. The Exodus, the giving of the law, and the account of creation matter not because they allow us to predict future physical events, but because they define who we are and how we are to act. These are practical consequences of a different kind, and they fall outside the domain to which Reichenbach’s pragmatic justification of scientific induction applies.

I hope this essay has shown that one can affirm Scripture, including its account of creation, as literally true, while also recognizing modern science as indispensable for understanding and navigating the future.
