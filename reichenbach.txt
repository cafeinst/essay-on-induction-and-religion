I believe that Scripture is literally true, including its account of creation. I also believe that modern science is indispensable for understanding and navigating the future. In this essay, I argue that these commitments are not in conflict, by examining Hans Reichenbach’s response to David Hume’s problem of induction.

Consider the following problem: The sun has risen in the morning every day in the past. How do we know that tomorrow the sun will rise? Hume generalized this question by asking how we can justify the inference from observed cases to unobserved cases without circularity. We humans do this all the time, yet the answer to this question has puzzled philosophers.

For instance, I once asked a non-philosopher how we know that the sun will rise tomorrow, given that it has risen every day in the past. She replied, “Because the appearance of the sun rising is the result of the earth spinning on its axis every day. Since the earth always spins on its axis, we can expect that the sun will rise tomorrow morning.”

While her statement is scientifically accurate, philosophically it is circular. I could have challenged her by asking, “But how do we know that the earth will continue spinning on its axis tomorrow?” Perhaps she would have responded, “Because nothing is stopping the earth from spinning on its axis.” But I suspect she would not have understood the essence of my question.

I do not mean this as an insult. I once asked a PhD chemist the same question and received a similar answer. Most modern people are trained to think in this scientific way, which is natural given that we live in an age shaped by scientific explanation.

But to truly understand nature, I think it is essential to have a good answer to Hume's problem of induction, since without some answer to Hume’s problem there is no non-pragmatic rational foundation for scientific belief, as science is fundamentally based on induction.

The only response to Hume’s problem of induction that I have found convincing in the literature is Hans Reichenbach’s pragmatic justification of induction. Reichenbach essentially argued: Either the future resembles the past or it does not. If it does not resemble the past, then all predictions about the future are equally reasonable in principle. If the future does resemble the past, then it is logical to make predictions based on the assumption that the future resembles the past. Hence, the most reasonable predictive strategy assumes that the future resembles the past, since this strategy is optimal in both situations. Notice that this solution does not claim that the future resembles the past. It only claims that the optimal procedure for predicting the future is based on the assumption that the future resembles the past.

The following is a great dilemma that has confounded many religious people: The Biblical account of world history contradicts the majority consensus of scientists as to their account of world history. For instance, according to Scripture the universe is less than 6,000 years old. According to science, the universe is billions of years old. This is a huge discrepancy. Some religious apologists have dealt with this discrepancy by playing around with definitions, for instance redefining the word day in Scripture to mean a period of time, since by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, time is relative and the notion of a day could not have even been defined until the fourth day of creation when the sun was created with the moon and the stars. Others have put forth scientific arguments for young earth.

Another great dilemma is evolution: the assertion that primitive forms of life evolved through random mutations into the higher forms of life we see on earth today over millions of years, as opposed to the account in Genesis that says that all animal life was created on the fifth and sixth day of creation. And there is the global flood which the book of Genesis asserts happened a few thousand years ago, which most scientists say there is no geological evidence for existing. One could defend the Bible by trying to refute modern science, but the odds are that one will not be believed by the masses who believe in science. The only way to convince the masses would be to convince the scientists who show no signs of backing down from their assertion that there was no global flood and that evolution is the best scientific theory available to explain how life came about.

As a person who believes that Scripture is literally true, I used to take the approach that scientists were either wrong because science is by nature uncertain or because the scientific theories were a case of misapplied extrapolation of data from today into the past. I used to argue with evolutionists on the Usenet group talk.origins with this point of view with little success of convincing anyone that my position is correct. The truth is I never felt that my position was that strong to begin with, not because it is wrong but because my position did not answer questions that people are naturally interested in, like where did we come from? The literal answer in Genesis was clearly written not as an answer to satisfy a person's curiosity about science. It is clearly a summary of a complex process that no human truly understands. It always bothered me that the Bible being a Divine book that is supposed to answer all great questions man has about life and the universe should have a better answer than the Genesis account that I learned in elementary Hebrew school as a kid.

My current answer to the evolution vs creation debate instead of attacking science attacks the basis for how one can make any scientific statements about the past with any degree of certainty. Hans Reichenbach's pragmatic justification for induction makes it clear that induction is only justified when making predictions about the future, not retrodictions about the past. This is because only predictions about the near future can be tested. Retrodictions about the past cannot be tested. According to Reichenbach's justification, only predictions that can be tested have justification, since if a prediction cannot be tested pragmatically speaking it does not matter whether it is right or wrong. Hence, arguments about whether the universe is less than 6,000 years old or billions of years old are mute. We will never be able to know with absolute certainty which is right.

However, if
