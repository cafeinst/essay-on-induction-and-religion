Essay

I believe that Scripture is literally true, including its account of creation. I also believe that modern science is indispensable for understanding and navigating the future. In this essay, I argue that these commitments are not in conflict, by focusing on philosopher Hans Reichenbach’s response to philosopher David Hume’s problem of induction.

Consider the following question: the sun has risen every morning in the past. What, if anything, justifies our expectation that it will rise tomorrow? David Hume elevated this familiar example into a deeper philosophical problem: how can inferences from observed cases to unobserved ones be rationally justified without presupposing the very regularities they aim to establish? Although we rely on such inductive inferences constantly, their rational foundation has remained philosophically contentious for centuries.

I once posed this question to someone without formal philosophical training. She replied that the apparent rising of the sun is explained by the earth’s rotation on its axis, and that since the earth continues to rotate, we can reasonably expect the sun to rise again tomorrow.

While this response is scientifically sound, it is philosophically circular. One can press the question further by asking how we know that the earth will continue rotating tomorrow. At that point, one might appeal to the absence of any force that would halt its motion, or invoke Newton’s First Law. Such replies are entirely appropriate within the explanatory framework of physics, yet they do not address the deeper epistemological question of why we are justified in expecting the same laws and conditions to persist into the future.

This observation is not intended as a criticism of intelligence or scientific competence. I have raised similar questions with scientists holding advanced degrees and received comparable answers. The pattern reflects not a deficiency, but the fact that modern education rightly prioritizes scientific explanation over philosophical justification—a natural emphasis in a culture shaped by the extraordinary success of science. Yet if we wish to understand the foundations of science itself, it is essential to confront Hume’s problem of induction, for without some response to that problem there is no rational basis for scientific belief, which ultimately depends on inductive inference.

The only response to Hume’s problem of induction that I have found convincing in the literature is Hans Reichenbach’s pragmatic justification of induction. Reichenbach essentially argued: Either the future resembles the past or it does not. If it does not necessarily resemble the past, then all predictions about the future are equally reasonable in principle. And if the future does resemble the past, then it is logical to make predictions based on the assumption that the future resembles the past. Hence, the most reasonable predictive strategy assumes that the future resembles the past, since this strategy is optimal in both situations. Notice that this resolution does not claim that the future resembles the past. It only claims that the optimal procedure for predicting the future is based on the assumption that the future resembles the past. 

The following is a great dilemma that has confounded many religious people: The Biblical account of world history contradicts the majority consensus of scientists regarding the history of the universe. For instance, according to Scripture, the universe is less than six thousand years old. According to science, the universe is billions of years old. This is a huge discrepancy. Some religious apologists have dealt with this discrepancy by being liberal with definitions, for instance redefining the word "day" in Scripture to mean a period of time, since by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, time is relative and a day could not have even been well-defined until the fourth day of creation when the sun was created along with the moon and the stars. Others have put forth scientific arguments for a young earth. And some have even put forth arguments that the scientific evidence for an old universe is just a test of one's faith - if one believes the universe is billions of years, he rejects the authority of Scripture and therefore lacks faith.

Another great dilemma for many religious people concerns evolution. According to evolutionary theory, primitive forms of life developed through random mutations into the higher forms of life we see on earth today over millions of years. This stands in contrast to the account in Genesis, which states that animal life and humans were created on the fifth and sixth days of creation as distinct species. And there is also the account of a global flood, which the book of Genesis describes as having occurred a few thousand years ago, and for which most scientists say there is no supporting geological evidence. 

One possible response to the tension between Scripture and science is to challenge modern scientific claims directly. I once adopted this strategy, holding that scientific theories about origins were either unreliable due to the inherent uncertainty of science, or the result of unwarranted extrapolations from present observations into the distant past. I defended this view in debates over evolution with limited persuasive success. In retrospect, the weakness of this approach was not that it was demonstrably false, but that it failed to address the questions that most naturally motivate scientific inquiry, such as where we come from and how the world came to be. The account in Genesis was not written to satisfy scientific curiosity or to function as a technical explanation of natural processes. Rather, it presents a compressed and schematic account of realities whose full complexity lies beyond current human understanding. Unsurprisingly, this proved unsatisfying to those seeking a scientific explanation. This realization led me to reconsider not the truth of science or Scripture, but the grounds on which scientific claims about the distant past are justified.

My current approach therefore avoids attacking science and instead examines the grounds on which scientific claims about the distant past are justified. Reichenbach’s pragmatic defense of induction makes clear that induction earns its authority through successful prediction of future events, not through retrodictions about the past. This is especially true of unique and unrepeatable occurrences that cannot be experimentally re-entered or varied. Because only future-directed predictions admit of direct empirical testing, claims about the distant past do not enjoy the same kind or degree of pragmatic justification within Reichenbach’s framework as predictive laws governing repeatable phenomena. Consequently, disputes over whether the universe is thousands or billions of years old lack the epistemic standing of predictive scientific claims, since they cannot be adjudicated through future predictive success. Reichenbach’s solution does not license belief in any particular historical narrative; it only licenses methods that prove themselves through future success.

It is important to note that not all retrodictions are epistemically on the same footing. In many cases, scientific inferences about the past are justified precisely because they contribute to reliable predictions about the future. For example, engineers often infer the past cause of a structural failure in order to predict how similar structures will behave under comparable conditions and to prevent future failures. In such cases, retrodiction is not an end in itself, but a tool for improving future-oriented prediction. These predictions are conditional and model-dependent; their success does not uniquely privilege one historical narrative over all others, but only demonstrates internal coherence within a given framework. By contrast, retrodictions that concern unique, unrepeatable events in the distant past, such as the precise origin of the universe or the detailed history of early life, do not play this predictive role. They do not guide future action, nor can they be tested by their success in prediction. Within Reichenbach’s pragmatic framework, such claims therefore lack the same rational authority as inductive predictions that bear on the future.

Seen in this light, the conflict between Genesis and science arises only when scientific retrodictions are treated as if they carried the same pragmatic authority as predictive laws, a status that Reichenbach’s justification does not grant them. Reichenbach’s justification applies only to inferential methods whose success can be evaluated through future experience, a condition that predictive laws satisfy but most claims about unique events in the distant past do not.

This does not mean that claims about the past are irrelevant in every context. The events described in Scripture are not offered as scientific reconstructions intended to support prediction or technological control. Rather, they function as the foundation of a religious worldview that shapes how people understand themselves, their obligations, and their relationship to God. In this sense, biblical claims about the past have profound implications for the present and the future, not by guiding empirical prediction, but by grounding meaning, moral responsibility, and communal identity.

From this perspective, the authority of Scripture does not rest on its ability to compete with scientific retrodictions, but on its role in shaping how one ought to live. The Exodus, the giving of the Law, and the account of creation matter not because they allow us to predict future physical events, but because they define who we are and how we are to act. These are practical consequences of a different kind, and they fall outside the domain to which Reichenbach’s pragmatic justification of scientific induction applies.

Science governs what we can expect; Scripture governs what we are for. Confusing these domains produces a false conflict that dissolves once their distinct forms of justification are understood. I hope this essay has shown that one can affirm Scripture, including its account of creation, as literally true, while also recognizing modern science as indispensable for understanding and navigating the future.
